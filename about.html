      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Machine learning engineer and applied researcher exploring the intersection of AI, music, and human perception.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I grew up moving between different fields, from engineering to art, theory to practice, curiosity to constraint. As a child, I was drawn to systems and how parts work together. Creative activities helped me test these ideas. Music was my first space to experiment. Before learning any formal technical skills, I picked up structure, timing, and variation by manipulating sounds and exploring patterns intuitively.</p>
      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I actively sought opportunities to combine disciplines. I built original datasets for projects that applied signal processing and machine learning to perception, often starting from raw signals rather than curated inputs. When tools or resources were unavailable, I designed my own experimental setups, from controlled sensing environments to data collection pipelines.</p>
      <p>I am especially motivated by the idea that technology should serve as a mirror rather than a director. Much of my creative and technical work has focused on revealing latent structures in music, images, and data&mdash;such as translating musical patterns into visual representations or using perceptual signals to expose hidden regularities in behavior.</p>

      <h2>Research Vision</h2>
      <p>I perceive music as a compressed form of cognition, where rhythm reflects time perception, harmony embodies expectation, and timbre evokes memory. My long-term research goal is to design multimodal AI systems capable of generating audiovisual narratives grounded in cognitive models of musical structure and human perception.</p>
      <p>I am particularly interested in systems for performance, opera, film, and interactive art that position music as a primary organizing force rather than a decorative element.</p>

      <h2>Creative Practice</h2>
      <p><strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> is my long-term experimental electronic music project, where I explore structure, rhythm, and gradual transformation through performance and composition. As a member of Discos Graves (Lima) and the Residencia Kai artist residency (Sacred Valley), I perform experimental downtempo/electronic sets and give talks on music conceptualization and the intersection of technology and art.</p>
      <p>This creative practice serves as a parallel research space, grounding my technical work in lived musical experience and shaping how I think about intention, expressivity, and audience perception in generative systems.</p>
